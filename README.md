# Kuba-birthdayCard

This is a game created for my partner as an unconventional birthday card. 
We've decided with his closest friends and family to get him a high-quality new mattress as a gift. He has quite serious back problems and many sleepless nights caused by bad bed selection.
The game was supposed to be cheesy and make him laugh. We are both dog-lovers, that should explain the theme.

To practice my skills while attending Web Development Bootcamp, as well as to give something "hand-made" I have come up with this idea and had a lot of fun making it.

The game is done with JavaScript with the P5.js library.

//The time was really limited, the organization of the code could be improved.
